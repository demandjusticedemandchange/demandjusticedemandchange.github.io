			<div class="list-card">
				<div>
					<h3>Independent Investigation and Prosecution</h3>
					<span>Cases should not rely on the police investigating themselves.</span>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="list-card">
				<div>
					<h3>Body Cams and Filming of Police</h3>
					<span>Cameras protect both police and citizens. Require body and dash cams, ban the police from taking recording devices.</span>
				</div>
			</div>	
					
			<div class="list-card">
				<div>
					<h3>Training</h3>
					<span>Re-evaluate current training practices. Require regular retraining and re-evaluation. Focus on de-escalation and community building.</span>
				</div>

			<div class="list-card">
				<div>
					<h3>Decriminalize minor offenses, end racist policies such as stop-and-frisk.</h3>
					<span>Jaywalking should not get you killed.</span>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="list-card">
				<div>
					<h3>Limit reach and use of force.</h3>
					<span>Deadly force should be a last resort. Re-evaluate the use of "Resisting Arrest". End no-knock warrents. Demilitarize the police.</span>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="list-card">
				<div>
					<h3>Collection of data.</h3>
					<span>Due to a lack of data current practices are unable to be evaluated on usefulness and harmfulness. Establish a publicly accessible, online, database tracking all police conduct.</span>
				</div>

			<h2 class="section-title">Phase 2: Needs</h2>
			<div class="list-card">
				<div>
					<h3>There is a lot of work ahead of us.</h3>
					<span>Police brutality and the disproportionate targeting of minorities is merely a symptom of the disease. America has deep rooted racial issues that require institutional changes. Centuries of systematic racism, enforced, promoted, and endorsed by the state won't disappear overnight.</span>
